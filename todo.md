# Priority 1 - Needs to be done
- Gene Graph (Kristian)
    - Take top tree in different time stamps and visualise traits

- Implement Pine and Shrub into blender (Tiago
    - Thickness in lsystem 

- Tweak parameter and show shadow/neighbour interaction in scenarios:
- Scenarios (lot of tweaking of parameters): (Kristian)
    - e.g Water shortrage - overgrowth is even more limited
    - Use scenarios to show how the behaviour can be simulated in our toolbox
    - Show four simulations (e.g water shortage/surplus, long winters/summers; nordic vs equatorial simulation)
    - Document spacing/locations of trees in these scenarios


# Priority 2 - Very nice to be done
- Forest Environment (Theoretically Kristian)
    - Tiling with biomes
        - 5 different tiles with rules to promote/constraint growth, adjacency, or preventing growth. 
    - Height map (even more extra nice)

- Implement more l-systems but with more variation 
    - Problem example: pine trees look like T's and not like trees when genes grow too dominant
    - Even fix the current l-systems to make them a bit more interesting.

# Priority 3 - Perhaps after project
- Interactivity 
    - Would need to be in javascript or another engine
    - three.js 
- Website
    - This comes after an interactive model being made in three.js
- GitHub Documentation
    - Implement slides & explanations of project into the github
- Self-generating species 
    - Production rules would evolve
    - Or at-least genes become seperate enough
- Optimise rendering and implement GPU speed-ups
