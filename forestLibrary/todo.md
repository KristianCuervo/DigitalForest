# Blender
- ask about the several splines (keep solid tree)
- make sure init_width is implemented in all branches


# Trees
- Select what trees to use in simulation
- Fine tune "alternative production rules" and their params
- Gene pool & Breedability characteristics
if time: make textures
- Max age to prevent micro branches


# Game
- Balancing 
-- fitness functions
-- growth constraints
-- death rolls


# Fun stuff if we have time 

## Biomes
idea 1:
- Adding several types of forests which have different biomes 
idea 2:
- seasons in simulation
idea 3:
- using WFC to create a tiles

## Goal:
- Make simulation 365 days long with four different seasons
